I'm a bioinformatician passionate about uncovering hidden patterns in complex biological data and translating them into actionable insights for experimental research. I am currently working at Resolve Biosciences, contributing to the development of spatial transcriptomics technologies. I program prototype instruments and apply computational pipelines to improve workflows and ensure reproducibility.

In my previous work at the Bioinformatics Group of the Ruhr University Bochum, I designed and implemented deep learning models to extract phylogenetic insights. There, I also developed methods integrating thermodynamics models with deep learning to predict RNA secondary structures. Before that, I was part of the Microbial Biology Group in Bochum, where I developed the computational pipeline for Lead-Seq, combining high-throughput sequencing data analysis with bioinformatic workflows to probe RNA structures at cellular scales. Leveraging my expertise in RNA sequencing, I contributed to interdisciplinary projects investigating regulatory networks controlled by small RNAs, combining computational analysis with biological interpretation.
