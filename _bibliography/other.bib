    abstract = { Evolutionary information is an important guide for uncovering biological mechanisms in structural biology as well as other fields of biology. Here, we present a neural network based approach that infers phylogenetically informative features in genotype or phenotype data by training a neural network in a way that the output features of the network match a presupposed reference phylogeny. Building on the well-established role of quartets in distance based phylogeny, our approach translates naturally to a quartet-based loss function for training neural networks. In a proof-of-concept study, we use quartet loss training to bacterial ribosomal RNA sequences and demonstrate that distances between the inferred features well reflect the reference phylogeny. Furthermore, we discuss how the approach can potentially be utilized to infer mechanisms in structural biology.},

  abstract = {Many bacterial pathogens are known to adjust their life style upon being exposed to diverse
environmental factors. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, for example, regulates the transcription of
more than 300 genes depending on temperature indicating the ingestion by its mammalian
host. This adaptation is further complemented by several additional regulatory layers. RNA
thermometers (RNAT), for example, regulate the expression of the pathogen’s major virulence
regulator LcrF on translational level, as well as the translation of several other genes. To
further investigate the influence of temperature on the structurome of Y. pseudotuberculosis in
vivo as well as in vitro, lead-seq and PARS (parallel analysis of RNA structure) experiments
were executed at both 25 °C and 37 °C. The chosen thermal conditions mimic the temperature
in the external reservoir as well as the host’s body temperature. This study aimed at the
analysis of the resulting data.
To generate information about pairing states from structure probing experiments, reactivity
scores were calculated from the resulting data. The reliability of information provided by
these scores was improved by implementing novel steps in the calculation pipeline,
accounting for lack of data as well as for the overall amplitude of background noise.
Temperature-induced unfolding of RNAs was found in vivo as well as in vitro. Furthermore, a
significant higher structuredness of untranslated regions at the 5ʹ-end of the transcript (5ʹ-
UTR) compared to the coding sequence was identified in vivo. This difference was not
detectable at 37 °C. A three-nucleotide structural pattern was found to be present in the coding
region of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) at both temperatures, but not in the non-coding regions.
The data resulting from in vivo structure probing were also used to improve RNA structure
prediction. The application of this method to RNAs sampled at both temperatures suggested
that mRNAs might be less thermo-stable than non-coding RNAs.
To identify structural changes standing out against the general unfolding of RNA, a new
method was developed. With this method, the accumulation of significant structure alteration
in the 5ʹ-UTR of mRNAs in vivo was detected. The approach was applied to predict about 80
new RNAT candidates, among which at least six represent verified RNATs.},
